# st-petersburg-investments-analysis
Through this project, We conducted a comprehensive analysis of non-school district taxable property values on commercial corridors in the CRA since 2018, providing valuable insights into annual changes and overall trends. Using the technical skills in data analysis and visualization, we developed an interactive visualization that ranks the commercial corridors based on the percentage change in non-school district taxable values, allowing stakeholders to easily identify which corridors experienced the highest and lowest increases. The results of this project provide crucial information for investors and policymakers in the City of St. Petersburg, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding investments and further developments in the commercial corridors. Overall, this project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and providing valuable insights to stakeholders.
